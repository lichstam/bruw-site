        Let me share a story from my own life of how I came up with the idea behind bruw. I love coffee, and so does my spouse, but in the mornings we had to fight over who's turn it is to make it. And when you want that perfect cup of freshly brewed coffee, you would want the brewing process to be easy aswell. 
        A few years before we'd use those standard automatic coffee makers with coffee from the grocery store. At one point, after traveling many countries and trying out premium coffees, I decided that I want to be able to make it at home. I bought the classic equipment like Chemex, V60, the goose neck pourover and a scale. Then I started to experiment. I used my phone's timer and wrote down how long the coffee should bloom, how many grams of grounded coffee I should use, and how many times I would have to pour and wait. This process was gruesome and I (literally) burned the coffee, my money and time.

        After some time experimenting and searching through the internet I came up with a counting formula for a pretty good brew. Now the next step was to teach my spouse how to make that perfect cup. This process was, again, tiresome and it required me to help and supervise her so the coffee wouldnâ€™t get burned. Our frustration grew. I thought there has to be another way. 
        Since my background is in engineering, and I am working as a software developer I started to sketch on an app that would do all the counting for me. My wish was that you would only have to put in the amount of coffee that you want as an end product, for example one cup or 500 mL (17oz). The app would count the amount of coffee beans required, with a few other parameters such as brewing method, temperature and bean type.

        That's how Bruw was born :).

      There are many coffee brands out there but I would like to share two of which I use to brew a lot.

        Koppi

        This is a Swedish brand from the small city Helsingborg in Scania that makes incredibily good coffee. Once you manage to brew these beans just right you'll be delighted by how soft yet powerful the roast is. 
        A favourite of mine is the colombian Caturra from the farm Finca el Porvenir or as the owner calls it: Caturra Mejorado. The story goes that they planted 18.000 Caturra trees and found only 2 to be resistant to leaf rust. They took the seeds from these and now they have around 3000 of them.
        Everything is hand made and the owners pay deep attention to details, such as how the beans are washed, fermentated and dried - which is what eventually adds up to an incredibily good cup of coffee

        Five Elephant - Decaf

        Sometimes too much coffee means too much caffeine. That's why I always keep a decaf in reserve. One that I really like is sold by Five Elephant, a small coffee chain in Berlin. This again is also a Colombian coffee from a couple of smaller farms. It's processed with Ethyl Actetate (that's how the coffee becomes decaffeinated). Let's face it, decafs usually don't have the same punch and richness in its flavour but this bean from Five Elephant is truly an exception. It's on the fruitier side and doesn't have the distinct decaf taste such coffee usually have. In other words, a very good coffee to be enjoyed anytime.

      Be your own Barista everyday

      Have you ever tried third wave coffee? I did so a couple of years ago and haven't looked back since. 
      Unfortunately I wasn't able to brew this kind of coffee myself, consequently making me spend a lot of money on a freshly brewed cup everyday. While I think the baristas making your coffee truly deserve every penny I just couldnt afford it, which is why I decided to learn how to make the perfect cup myself. After years of brewing various types of beans I gained full understanding and knowledge of how to perform the art of brewery with three different types of methods; V60, AeroPress and Chemex. I'll give you the basics of those, hopefully bringing you closer to becoming a hobby barista!

      Assuming you have high quality beans and water of neutral taste, the end result of your brew will depend on the water's temperature, how fine you grind the beans, how much water you pour each time and how long the pauses are inbetween. Lastly, the three brewing methods will produce coffee of varying intensity. AeroPress gets the most out of the beans while V60 is somewhat in the middle followed by Chemex providing the lightest cup. 

      A google search will get you different recipes for these which basically specify all of the parameters mentioned above. One favourite method of mine is the 4:6. Let's look at an example:
      Brewing 300 ml of coffee in five pours means that one pour equals approximately (I'll get to that soon) 300/5 = 60 ml. Now according to the ratio, 4:6 which basically means 40%-60%, the first 40% of 300 ml that is 2 pours (120ml), determine the balance of sweetness and acidity. So how do you perform the actual balancing? It goes back to my mentioning of approximately - by varying the ratio within those 40%. Pouring 20 ml in the first run and the remaining 100 ml after that makes the coffee sweeter. The other way around would enchance the acidity instead.
      What about the 60% that are left? It lets you adjust the strength. More pours give stronger coffee. Less, as you might've guessed, makes it weaker. 
      Finally you can calculate the amount of beans to be used by first dividing 300/5 = 60 and then once again by 3, such that 60/3 = 20 g of beans. Normally we would start from the bean quantity and do the math reversed.

      Keep in mind that every bean is different and most often require some adjustment. Write your recipes down so you can keep track of them or even better, get an app for it. My personal recommendation of course is Bruw - an app I created for this purpose. It gives you access to a whole bunch of other recipes as well created by equally passionated coffee lovers!
