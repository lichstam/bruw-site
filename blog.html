      Be your own Barista everyday

      Have you ever tried third wave coffee? I did so a couple of years ago and haven't look back since. 
      Unfortunately I wasn't able to brew this kind of coffee myself, consequently making me spend a lot of money on a freshly brewed cup everyday. While I think the baristas making your coffee truly deserve every penny I just couldnt afford it, which is why I decided to learn how to make the perfect cup myself. After years of brewing various types of beans I gained full understanding and knowledge of how to perform the art of brewery with three different types of methods; V60, AeroPress and Chemex. I'll give you the basics of those, hopefully bringing you closer to becoming a hobby barista!

      Assuming you have high quality beans and water of neutral taste, the end result of your brew will depend on the water's temperature, how fine you grind the beans, how much water you pour each time and how long the pauses are inbetween. Lastly, the three brewing methods will produce coffee of varying intensity. AeroPress gets the most out of the beans while V60 is somewhat in the middle followed by Chemex providing the lightest cup. 

      A google search will get you different recipes for these which basically specify all of the parameters mentioned above. One favourite method of mine is the 4:6. Let's look at an example:
      Brewing 300 ml of coffee in five pours means that one pour equals approximately (I'll get to that soon) 300/5 = 60 ml. Now according to the ratio, 4:6 which basically means 40%-60%, the first 40% of 300 ml that is 2 pours (120ml), determine the balance of sweetness and acidity. So how do you perform the actual balancing? It goes back to my mentioning of approximately - by varying the ratio within those 40%. Pouring 20 ml in the first run and the remaining 100 ml after that makes the coffee sweeter. The other way around would enchance the acidity instead.
      What about the 60% that are left? It lets you adjust the strength. More pours give stronger coffee. Less, as you might've guessed, makes it weaker. 
      Finally you can calculate the amount of beans to be used by first dividing 300/5 = 60 and then once again by 3, such that 60/3 = 20 g of beans. Normally we would start from the bean quantity and do the math reversed.

      Keep in mind that every bean is different and most often require some adjustment. Write your recipes down so you can keep track of them or even better, get an app for it. My personal recommendation of course is Bruw - an app I created for this purpose. It gives you access to a whole bunch of other recipes as well created by equally passionated coffee lovers!
